# Discord-Bot-GUI
 I made a discord bot and wanted a way to see all the guilds/channels/messages that the bot could see. No real functionality beyond mass message deletion right now.

 "npm start" runs the application. Accessible in your browser at localhost:3000 
 "npm run electron" launches electron if you've installed it.

I've included many things that I probably should have gitignore'd , but at least it works
